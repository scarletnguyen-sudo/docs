  To maximize returns from your ad spend, focus on three key principles:

  1. **Eliminate waste early** by pausing low-performing SKUs.
  2. **Reallocate budgets** to SKUs that deliver consistent GMV and ROAS.
  3. **Compete smartly** for top ad positions with the right bidding strategy.
</Note>

## 1. Cut Wasted Spend Early

Eliminate unproductive cost by pausing SKUs that underperform over time.

- **Pause inactive SKUs:**\
  If `ROAS (L3D) = 0` and `Spend (L3D) > benchmark`, pause the SKU immediately.
- **Avoid low-stock spend:**
  - Pause ads when `Stock < threshold (e.g., 10 units)`.
  - Resume once stock exceeds threshold.

## 2. Capture More Quality Traffic

Prioritize your high-efficiency SKUs in the top 5 ad positions, where **~70% of impressions** typically occur.

- **Reduce bid when performance drops:**\
  If `Keyword ROAS ≤ 5` **and** `Avg. Position ≤ 4` **and** `Impressions > benchmark`,\
  → Reduce bid by **10%** (until the minimum allowed price).
- **Increase bid to reach top 5:**\
  If `Avg. Position > 4` **and** `Impressions ≤ 400`,\
  → Increase bid by **10%** (up to benchmark cap).
- **Compete for top 1 (only when profitable):**\
  If `ROAS > benchmark` **and** `Position > 2` **and** `Direct Items Sold > 1`,\
  → Increase bid by **10%** (up to benchmark cap).

## 3. Maximize Selling Opportunities Throughout the Day

Ensure your best SKUs remain visible during key traffic hours.

| Time Range  | Action      | Criteria                              |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 00:00–03:00 | Resume SKUs | SKUs with zero impressions            |
| 03:00–08:59 | Pause SKUs  | Zero sales and high cost              |
| 09:00–23:59 | Resume SKUs | Active sales and ROAS above benchmark |

## 4. Reallocate Budgets Dynamically

Ensure your budget distribution reflects actual performance contribution.

- **Redistribute budget proportionally:**\
  SKUs contributing **80% of GMV or ROAS** should receive **at least 80% of the budget**.

**Example:**\
If 3 SKUs drive most ad GMV, allocate the majority of spend to them to avoid dilution.

## 5. Group Campaigns for Efficiency

Organize your campaigns logically to reduce overlap and simplify budget control.

- **By category:**\
  Group products under the same product line\
  _(e.g., Toothpaste vs. Toothbrush)_.
- **By objective:**\
  Separate campaigns focused on **Sales**, **Traffic**, or **Efficiency**.
- **By performance contribution:**

  | Type                | Description                       | Example              |
  | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
  | **Hero products**   | High budget, strong GMV           | Whitening Toothpaste |
  | **Growth products** | Medium budget, potential to scale | Sensitive Toothpaste |
  | **Tail products**   | Test budget, minimal focus        | Kids Toothpaste      |
