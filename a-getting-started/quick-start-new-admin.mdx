This guide helps you understand the workspace layout and where to find key modules for automation, reporting, and insights.

## Overview

When you log into [one.epsilo.io](https://one.epsilo.io), the workspace opens to your **dashboard view**, showing your latest media data and automation performance.

The interface is divided into three key areas:

1. **Sidebar** — Navigate between products and tools.
2. **Main dashboard** — View campaign metrics and activity.
3. **Top bar** — Access filters, search, and workspace settings.

## Sidebar

The sidebar is your primary navigation tool.\
It groups features by function — matching how operators plan, automate, and analyze.

| Section                     | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intraday**                | View real-time performance (GMV, ROAS, spend, impressions) across marketplaces. |
| **Keyword Lab**             | Research keywords, track search trends, and discover new opportunities.         |
| **Digital Shelf Analytics** | Analyze product visibility, ranking, and share of shelf across marketplaces.    |
| **Marketing Automation**    | Manage campaign scheduling, budget distribution, and automation scripts.        |
| **Operation Index**         | Track efficiency, automation coverage, and process improvement metrics.         |
| **Performance Index**       | Benchmark campaign performance against targets.                                 |
| **Partner Center**          | Manage agency access, workspaces, and shared reports.                           |
| **Subscription & Passport** | View your billing plan and connected credentials.                               |

## Dashboard

The **dashboard** adapts to the module you’re in.

- **Intraday view** shows live marketplace performance.
- **Automation view** lists running workflows and recent rule triggers.
- **Keyword or Shelf dashboards** visualize trends and ranking changes.

You can use the **filters** at the top to refine your view:

- Marketplace
- Country
- Media channel
- Storefront

### Updating Data

Dashboards auto-refresh every few minutes, but you can also click the **⟳ refresh icon** to pull live data manually.

---

## Command Bar

Use the command bar (`⌘ + K` / `Ctrl + K`) to jump instantly between:

- Campaigns
- Automations
- Reports
- Connected stores

Type “budget”, “shelf”, or “Botep” to find the related module instantly.

> ⚡ Try it: Press `⌘ + K` and search for “Distribution” to open your Budget Distribution dashboard.

---

## Workspace Switcher

If you manage multiple brands or regions, use the **workspace switcher** at the top left to move between environments.

Each workspace stores:

- Its own storefront connections
- Members and roles
- Automation rules and reports

> 🧠 **Tip:** Use separate workspaces for each brand or business unit for clearer reporting.

---

## Filters and Sorting

Every module supports consistent filtering and sorting:

- Click **Filter** to narrow by country, store, or category.
- Click **Sort** to arrange by ROAS, GMV, or spend.
- Save frequently used filters as **custom views** in _Marketing Automation → Custom Views_.

---

## Activity & Notifications

The **Activity Center** shows updates on automation triggers, alerts, and AI insights.\
Botep will surface key findings like:

> “ROAS dropped 12% on Lazada last 3 hours – check Budget Distribution.”

Notifications appear in real time at the top right of the screen.
