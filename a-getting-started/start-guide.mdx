Let’s get started!

### Navigating your workspace

On the left side of your screen, you'll find the **main navigation bar**, which serves as your starting point.

### Workspace name

At the very top, you’ll see your workspace name. One click lets you switch between different workspaces that you have access to.

### Workflows

Right below your workspace name, you’ll be able to see workflows that you’ve saved.\
These act like folders for holding specific views and tables used in your daily workflow.

- **Private workflows:** Only visible to you.
- **Shared workflows:** Visible and usable by every user in your workspace.

### Products

Below the workflows are the products you’re subscribed to.\
Each product houses a number of sections, and each section is made up of tables.

### Bottom bar

At the bottom of the navigation bar, you’ll find a **question mark icon** for quick access to menu items:

- **Get support:** Reach out to our support team for requests, issues, or tracking past tickets.
- **Submit a feature request:** Have a feature idea? Share it with our product team directly.

## Navigating tables

Tables are the heart and soul of Epsilo — powerful mini-dashboards within each section.

### Configurations

This is where you set up the parameters of the table.

- **Time period:** Adjust the time range of the data.\
  Pick a date, a range, or a relative period (e.g., _last 15 days_).\
  To combine non-consecutive days or ranges, use **Advanced custom**.
- **Filter:** Apply single or multi-step conditions to refine your data.\
  Combine filters with an _OR_ operator or temporarily disable a filter.
- **Sort:** Select one or more columns to sort your data by (ascending or descending).
- **View by:** On some tables, you can change the dimension (e.g., view GMV by day, week, or month).
- **Cohort:** Compare the current period to another (e.g., _last 3 double days vs previous 3 double days_).\
  Comparisons appear as subtext in applicable columns.

### Properties

Click the rightmost **kebab menu (⋮)** to select which properties (metrics) appear as columns or cards.

- **Dimensions:** Stable identifiers (e.g., _Storefront name_, _SKU name_, _Company_).
- **Attributes:** Current statuses unaffected by time filters (e.g., _Campaign status_, _% budget today_, _Stock_).
- **Metrics:** Calculated or performance values (e.g., _Ads spend_, _CPC_, _ROAS_, _Ads items sold_).

### Data

This is where the results of your setup appear — the data itself.\
There are several ways to interact with your table:

- **Group by:** Combine items in one column (like pivot tables in a spreadsheet).\
  For example, tag some SKUs as “Focus SKUs” and collapse them together.\
  You can group by multiple columns simultaneously, nesting each group within another.
- **Footer calculations:** At the bottom of a table, perform column-based operations (_Sum_, _Average_, _Count all_, _Count unique_, etc.), applied across all rows — even unloaded ones.
- **Kebab menus:** Present across table cells and column headers.
  - When used on a **column header**, the action applies to your entire filtered dataset (including hidden rows).

## Saving and sharing views

Once you’ve configured your table, you can **save it as a view**.\
Create as many views as needed and switch between them easily.

### Name and describe your view

Click the kebab menu to rename or describe your view for quick recognition later.

### Duplicate your views for experiments

If you want to test new filters or metrics without altering your original setup, simply **duplicate** the view.

### Explore views from others in your workspace

Browse views created by teammates.\
If you find one you want, click its kebab menu and select **Clone view** to add it to your own list.
