Epsilo workspaces are built for collaboration.\
Each member has a defined role that controls what they can view, edit, or automate.

Use this guide to understand available roles, assign permissions, and keep your workspace secure.

## Overview

Every workspace includes four main roles:

| Role       | Access level                                                            | Best for                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Owner**  | Full access to billing, workspace settings, and storefront connections. | Business or team lead           |
| **Admin**  | Manage members, create and edit automations, and view all campaigns.    | Performance or operations lead  |
| **Member** | Run campaigns, view dashboards, and trigger automations.                | Daily operator                  |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to dashboards and reports.                             | External partners or management |

> 💡 **Tip:** Use the **Principle of Least Privilege** — grant the lowest necessary access for each person.

## Adding and Managing Members

### Invite a new member

1. Go to **Workspace Settings → Members**.
2. Click **Invite**.
3. Enter the user’s work email.
4. Choose a role (Owner, Admin, Member, or Viewer).
5. Click **Send invite**.

Invitations expire after **7 days** if not accepted.\
Admins can resend or revoke invitations at any time.

### Update an existing member

1. From the **Members** list, select a user.
2. Use the role dropdown to adjust permissions.
3. Changes apply immediately — no need to resend invites.

### Remove a member

Owners and Admins can remove users at any time:

- Select the member → click **Remove from workspace**.
- All active automations remain intact, but ownership transfers to the workspace.
