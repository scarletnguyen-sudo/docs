Enterprise workspaces can enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** to simplify and centralize access management.

## Overview

Members can log in to their Epsilo workspace using Google, Microsoft, Email, or SSO—depending on the organization’s setup.  
Each workspace may enable or restrict specific login methods to comply with internal IT policies.

---

## Login Options

### Google for Work
If your organization uses **Google Workspace**, select **Sign in with Google for Work**.  
Epsilo authenticates you directly with your corporate Google account—ideal for Gmail-based domains.

### Microsoft for Work
If your organization manages users via **Microsoft 365** or **Azure AD**, choose **Sign in with Microsoft for Work**.  
Epsilo uses Microsoft’s OAuth flow and respects conditional access policies defined by your IT team.

### Email Login
You can also sign in manually with your **work email and password**:

1. Enter your work email.  
2. Input your password.  
3. Click **Continue with Email**.

If your workspace enforces SSO, you’ll automatically be redirected to the correct identity provider.

> 💡 **Tip:** Use your company-issued email (e.g., `name@brand.com`). Personal domains may not be supported.

---

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

SSO lets members access Epsilo with existing company credentials—no separate passwords required.  
Epsilo supports both **SAML 2.0** and **OIDC-based** integrations.

### Supported Identity Providers
- Google Workspace  
- Microsoft Azure AD  
- Okta  
- OneLogin  
- JumpCloud  

### How SSO Works
- Members are redirected to your identity provider for authentication.  
- Password-based logins can be disabled for added security.  
- Session tokens are renewed automatically via your provider.

### Configure SSO
1. Go to **Settings → Administration → Security**.  
2. Select **Enable SSO** and choose your provider.  
3. Add required metadata (ACS URL, Entity ID, certificate).  
4. Save and test authentication.

> 🏢 **Enterprise plans** can request setup support from **support@epsilo.io** to enforce domain-based or regional access policies.

## Switching Workspaces

You can access multiple Epsilo workspaces under the same account.

1. Click your **workspace name** in the top-left corner.  
2. Select **Switch workspace**.  
3. Choose an existing workspace or **Create / Join a Workspace**.

Each workspace keeps its own:
- Members and roles  
- Billing plan  
- Connected storefronts and data  

---

## Logging Out

Signing out from one workspace logs you out of all active sessions on that device.  
To re-enter, simply authenticate again with your preferred method.

---

## Summary

- Epsilo supports **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Email**, and **SSO** authentication.  
- **SSO (SAML / OIDC)** provides the most secure, scalable access control.  
- Admins can enforce login and IP restrictions per workspace.  
- Authentication and billing remain isolated per workspace.

> 🔒 Secure, centralized login keeps your automations and reports protected while making access effortless for every operator.
