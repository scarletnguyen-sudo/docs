description: Learn how workspaces organize your storefronts, automations, and team members in Epsilo.
---
A **workspace** is your team’s dedicated environment inside Epsilo.  
It contains your connected storefronts, members, automations, reports, and data settings — all isolated from other workspaces for security and clarity.

---

## Overview

Workspaces help operators and agencies manage multiple brands, countries, or clients in one Epsilo account.  
Each workspace has its own:
- Connected storefronts (Shopee, Lazada, TikTok Shop, etc.)
- Users and roles
- Automation rules and schedules
- Reporting dashboards and data visibility

> 💡 **Tip:** Think of a workspace as a brand or business unit — each with its own automation and reporting stack.

## Creating a Workspace

You can create a new workspace at any time.

1. Go to [one.epsilo.io/signup](https://one.epsilo.io/signup) or click **Create workspace** from the top-left switcher.  
2. Sign in with your company email (recommended).  
3. Name your workspace — e.g., “Brand A SG” or “Agency Ops – Indonesia.”  
4. Select region and default currency.  
5. Connect your first storefront.

Once created, your workspace will appear in the **workspace switcher** on the left navigation bar.

---

## Switching Between Workspaces

If you manage multiple brands or regions:
1. Click the **workspace name** at the top of the sidebar.  
2. Select another workspace from the dropdown.  
3. Your dashboards, automations, and reports update instantly to that environment.

> 🧠 Use a clear naming convention (e.g., “Brand / Country”) to make switching faster.

## Workspace Structure

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Workspace** | Top-level environment containing all data, users, and automations. |
| **Storefronts** | Connected Shopee, Lazada, or TikTok accounts. |
| **Members** | Team users assigned roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer). |
| **Automations** | Campaign rules, scheduling, and optimization scripts. |
| **Reports** | Dashboards and performance summaries generated by Botep AI. |

Each workspace is fully **isolated**, so automation changes or user edits in one do not affect others.

---

## Permissions and Ownership

| Role | Permissions |
|------|--------------|
| **Owner** | Create, rename, or delete workspaces; manage billing and connections. |
| **Admin** | Add members, connect storefronts, and configure automations. |
| **Member** | Run campaigns, view reports, and trigger automations. |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to dashboards and reports. |

> 🔒 Only Owners can delete or rename a workspace.

## Managing Storefronts

Each workspace can connect multiple marketplace storefronts.

1. Go to **Workspace Settings → Connections.**  
2. Click **Connect storefront.**  
3. Choose your platform (Shopee, Lazada, TikTok Shop).  
4. Authenticate with your marketplace credentials.  
5. The connection will appear under **Connected Stores.**

> ⚙️ Data from connected stores sync automatically every few hours or on-demand from the **Dashboard → Refresh** button.

---

## Best Practices

- Create one workspace per **brand, country, or client**.  
- Avoid sharing credentials across workspaces.  
- Keep workspace membership limited to active operators.  
- Review automations and roles quarterly.  
- Use **Botep’s AI Reports** to compare workspaces and benchmark efficiency.
