description: Learn how Epsilo protects your data, storefronts, and automations with enterprise-grade security and compliance.
---
Epsilo is built with enterprise-level security and compliance standards to protect your data and connected storefronts.  
This guide outlines how access, encryption, and permissions work inside every workspace.

---

## Overview

Security in Epsilo operates at three levels:

1. **Data protection** â€” encryption and isolation across tenants.  
2. **Access control** â€” role-based permissions and authentication.  
3. **Compliance** â€” policies that meet global data protection laws (GDPR, PDPA).

> ðŸ”’ Your connected marketplaces and reports are isolated to your workspace.  
> Only authorized members with defined roles can access your data.

## Data Protection

Epsilo uses strong encryption and storage standards to protect your assets.

| Area | Method |
|------|--------|
| **Data in transit** | TLS 1.2+ encryption for all requests and API traffic. |
| **Data at rest** | AES-256 encryption for all databases and backups. |
| **Token storage** | Encrypted and isolated by workspace; tokens never leave the secured environment. |
| **Backups** | Daily encrypted backups with automated recovery testing. |

All infrastructure runs in **regional cloud environments** with dedicated tenancy per customer cluster.

## Access Controls

Workspaces enforce strict **role-based access control (RBAC)**.

| Role | Access Level |
|------|---------------|
| Owner | Full control, including billing, members, and connected storefronts. |
| Admin | Manage users, automations, and campaigns. |
| Member | Operate campaigns and view reports. |
| Viewer | Read-only access to dashboards. |

Authentication options:
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** via Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, or Okta (Enterprise plan).  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for Owners and Admins.  
- Automatic **session expiry** after inactivity.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: Require SSO or 2FA for all admins to prevent unauthorized automation edits.

## Compliance and Privacy

Epsilo follows regional data protection frameworks to ensure transparency and control.

- **GDPR & PDPA compliance** for user and campaign data.  
- **Data residency**: information stored in the region defined by your workspace.  
- **Marketplace API compliance**: aligns with Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop integration policies.  
- Annual third-party **security audits** and vulnerability assessments.

You can request our latest compliance report by contacting **security@epsilo.io**.

## Best Practices for Teams

- Use **company-issued emails** for all invites.  
- Review the **Members & Roles** list quarterly.  
- Enable **2FA** for sensitive roles.  
- Avoid sharing access credentials across users.  
- Rotate marketplace tokens regularly in **Partner Center â†’ Connections**.

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security issue:
1. Immediately revoke affected user access under **Workspace Settings â†’ Members**.  
2. Notify the Epsilo team via **security@epsilo.io** with details of the event.  
3. Epsilo will initiate its incident-response procedure within **24 hours**.

> ðŸ§  Our internal monitoring continuously tracks anomalies in API usage and automation execution. Suspicious activity triggers real-time alerts to our ops team.
