Epsilo gives you full control of your campaign and automation data.  
You can export reports, metrics, or logs directly from the dashboard or through the Unified API.

Use this guide to learn how to extract your data safely and efficiently.

---

## Overview

Data exports allow you to:
- Generate campaign performance reports for analysis.  
- Share metrics with other teams or BI dashboards.  
- Download automation logs and audit history for compliance.  

All exports respect your workspace permissions â€” only authorized users can access campaign data.

## Exporting from Dashboards

### Campaign Reports

2. Use filters (Marketplace, Country, Storefront) to narrow your data.  
3. Click **Export â†’ CSV / Excel**.  
4. Choose a date range and metric set.  
5. Download the file once processing completes.

Exports include all visible columns â€” GMV, Ad Spend, ROAS, Orders, Impressions, Clicks, and Conversion Rate.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Save your preferred filters as a *Custom View* to reuse the same export setup later.

## Exporting via Unified API

Developers and analysts can integrate directly with the **Epsilo Unified API** for automated data retrieval.

### Example Use Cases
- Sync campaign data into BI tools (e.g., Looker, Power BI).  
- Combine performance data across Shopee, Lazada, and TikTok Shop.  
- Automate weekly report generation for multiple brands.

### API Access
1. Go to **Partner Center â†’ API Access**.  
2. Generate an **API token** (requires Owner or Admin permissions).  
3. Review available endpoints in [Unified API Documentation](../features/aggregate/unified-api).  
4. Query campaign metrics by date or campaign ID.

Example request:
```bash
GET /api/v1/campaigns?workspace_id=1234&date_range=2025-10-01:2025-10-16
