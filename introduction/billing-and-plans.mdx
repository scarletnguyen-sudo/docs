Epsilo offers flexible pricing plans for teams of all sizes — from small operators to enterprise networks.\
This guide explains how billing works, who can access invoices, and how to upgrade or manage your subscription.

## Overview

Billing is managed at the **workspace level**.\
Each workspace has one **Owner** (or designated Admin) responsible for payment details, invoices, and plan management.

You can access billing at any time from:

> **Sidebar → Subscription → Billing**
