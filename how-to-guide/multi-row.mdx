title: "Multi-row optimization: Bulk actions and mass actions"
description: "Take action across multiple rows of data in Epsilo tables using two powerful features: Bulk action and Mass action."
---

<Note>
  **TLDR**

  **Bulk action** = Apply changes only to the rows you’ve loaded and selected.

  **Mass action** = Apply changes to all rows in your filtered results, even those you haven’t loaded yet.
</Note>

## **Bulk action**

- Select individual rows manually or use the checkbox at the top-left corner to select all visible rows.
- Apply changes like adjusting bids, budgets, or keyword match types to **only the rows currently loaded**.
- Example: If you’ve loaded 20 rows out of 1,000 total results, bulk action will only affect those 20 rows.
- Best for: Precise adjustments where you want control over which rows are included or excluded.

## **Mass action**

- Initiated from a **column header kebab menu** (three vertical dots).
- Applies to **every row in your filtered results**, regardless of how many are loaded.
- After running a mass action, a CSV file will download showing success or failure for each row. (Platform integration coming soon.)
- Best for: Large-scale adjustments across thousands of rows without manually loading all results.

## **Use cases**

1. **Scale winning ad placements**
   - Filter: ROAS \> 10
   - Action: Mass action → Increase bidding price by 10%
   - Purpose: Quickly scale all high-performing placements across storefronts.
2. **Optimize low-performing campaigns**
   - Filter: ROAS \< 3
   - Action: Mass action → Change keyword match type from broad to exact
   - Purpose: Improve targeting to lift performance.
3. **Tagging branded keywords**
   - Filter: Keyword contains your brand name
   - Action: Mass action → Edit notes column → Tag as “Brand Keywords”
   - Purpose: Easily categorize and track branded campaigns for reporting.

## **Additional tips**

- Use Bulk action when precision is key.
- Use Mass action when scale and speed matter.
- Always double-check your filters before using Mass Action—it applies to all filtered results.
