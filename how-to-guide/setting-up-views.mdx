<Note>
  TLDR

  With advanced filtering, you can apply multiple conditions to refine your dataset using numeric, string, or logical operators. Sorting lets you order results by one or multiple columns. You can also group filters with **OR clauses**, temporarily disable filters, and save configurations for quick decision-making.

## **How advanced filtering works**

**Add multiple conditions:** Filter by metrics such as **budget utilization**, **ROAS**, or **category**.

**Operators:** Use `>`, `<`, `=`, or string-based operators like `contains` / `does not contain` depending on the data type.

**Filter groups with OR logic:** Combine multiple filters into a group to apply an **OR** clause. Example: ROAS \> 5 **AND** (Category = Hair **OR** Category = Skin).

**Disable filters:** Temporarily gray out filters without deleting them, making it easy to test variations without re-creating complex setup.

## **How sorting works**

**Single and multi-column sorting:** Order your data by revenue, GMV, or clicks.

**Ascending or descending:** Apply direction for each column to surface top- or bottom-performing data instantly.

## **Practical use cases**

Here are three common ways customers use advanced filtering and sorting:

1. **Identify top performers near budget limits**
   - Filter: ROAS \> 5
   - Filter: Budget utilization \> 80%
   - Purpose: Find ad objects to increase budget for before they cap out.

2. **Stop spend on underperforming ads**
   - Filter: ROAS \< 3
   - Filter: Budget utilization \< 80%
   - Purpose: Quickly spot ad objects wasting spend and stop spending.

3. **Prioritize restocking decisions**
   - Filter: Low stock levels
   - Sort: Items sold (descending)
   - Purpose: Identify fast-selling products that need urgent restocking.

   ## **Additional tips**
   - Save filtered views to reuse across your team.
   - Disable filters instead of deleting to test multiple scenarios.
   - Use filter groups with **OR** logic for flexible analysis.
