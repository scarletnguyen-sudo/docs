  **TLDR**

  Hyper automation scripts let you set up rules to automatically optimize your ads based on real-time conditions. You can create scripts in minutes, reuse them, review their success, and duplicate for quick edits.

## **How it works**

Hyper automation scripts in Epsilo start with defining your automation. You choose the target ad unit (ad object or ad placement) and set the rules that will trigger the script. These conditions can be simple, like when impressions drop below a threshold, or more complex with **AND/OR** logic to combine multiple scenarios.

Once the conditions are met, the script automatically executes the predefined actions, such as adjusting bids or pausing underperforming ads. Every action is logged for full visibility, allowing you to review results, duplicate scripts to scale across campaigns, and refine your automation strategy over time.

## **How to create a script step-by-step**

**Step 1: Navigate to the Hyper automation section**

- Go to **Hyper automation** in the left-hand menu.
- Click **New script** in either the **Ad object script** or **Ad placement script** table.
