<Note>
  **TLDR**

  Epsilo's Budget distribution auto-allocates funds to ad objects based on performance. It honors locked budgets, maintains minimums, and follows your chosen model. Triggers include daily resets, half-hourly checks, and manual updates. This keeps spending aligned with goals, prioritizes performance, and adapts automatically without manual work.

## **Benefits of Budget distribution**

- Keeps spend aligned with campaign goals without manual checks.
- Ensures high performing SKUs receive more budget.
- Adapts automatically to daily resets, performance shifts, and manual budget edits.
- Helps prevent overspending above campaign cap.

## **How Budget distribution works**

Budget distribution is Epsilo’s automated mechanism to allocate budgets from a higher ad level to a lower ad level. For example, you can set a budget at a campaign level, and Budget distribution would manage the allocation to the SKUs (Ad objects) within that campaign.

Budget distribution acts upon two main factors: trigger time and distribution model. The trigger time is when the budget will be distribution or re-distributed. The distribution model decides which metric to focus on when choosing which SKUs get what portion of the campaign budget.

When budget distribution is triggered, the following three-step process takes place:

1. **Locked budgets first:** Ad objects with locked budgets are funded first. For example if Ad Object A is locked at \$400, that amount is set aside.
2. **Minimum thresholds:** Each remaining ad object gets at least the marketplace minimum budget, depending on market.
3. **Remaining budget allocation:** The leftover is distributed by your selected model (e.g., spend, GMV, ROAS, fair share).

## **How to lock and unlock a budget**

When you change a budget at the ad object (SKU) level, that budget will be considered locked. This means that the campaign budget will not override your manual budget change. If you unlock a budget, that budget will be subject to change as a result of Budget distribution.

**To lock a budget:** In the Ad Object Optimization Table, open the _Ad Object Budget_ column, click the menu (⋮), and set a fixed budget.

**To unlock a budget:** Open the same menu and select _Enable auto-distribution_.

## **Triggers for when Budget distribution occurs**

Budget Distribution rebalances automatically in these scenarios:

1. **Daily distribution (daily reset):** At midnight, budgets are recalculated based on yesterday’s performance.
2. **Redistribution (every 30 minutes):** System checks live performance and adjusts spend to match trends.
3. **Auto distribution (auto-triggered following manual/scheduled changes):** Any manual budget edit or scheduled update triggers instant redistribution.

## **Available distribution models**

Choose a model that matches your goal:

**Ad Spend (Yesterday)** – Default; allocates by yesterday’s spend pattern. Best for maximizing budget utilization with low intraday fluctuation.

**Ad Spend (Today)** – Allocates by real-time spend today. Best for maximizing budget usage based on today's spending.

**Ad GMV (Today)** – Allocates more budget to SKUs driving today’s revenue. Best for maximizing top line revenue to the storefront.

**Impressions (Today)** – Favors SKUs with higher visibility today. Best for increasing awareness, especially from new or underserved product groups.

**ROAS (Today)** – Prioritizes SKUs with better return on ad spend today. Best for maximizing storefront efficiency.

**Fair (Equal)** – Splits remaining budget equally across ad objects. Best for giving all products a chance to demonstrate performance before switching to another model.

## **Best practices for Budget distribution**

- Always make sure the campaign budget ≥ sum of all locked ad object budgets + minimum ad object budgets. For example, if the campaign budget is \$70, with a locked ad object at \$60 and four unlocked ad objects requiring \$5 minimum, the system will require \$80 total. This leads to spend higher than the campaign budget.
- Additionally, you cannot set a budget below today’s spend or the marketplace minimum. To reduce the budget for the next day, schedule the budget ahead of time.
- After you’ve adjusted a budget for Ad objects, if you are not sure that the Campaign budget is sufficient, try reapplying a new value to the Campaign daily budget, the system will notify you if the budget is no longer sufficient.
