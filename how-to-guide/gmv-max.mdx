## **What Is GMV Max on Shopee?**

GMV Max is Shopee’s smart advertising model that automatically optimizes to maximize Gross Merchandise Value (GMV). It runs across Search, Discovery, Video, Games, and Coins placements so you don’t pick placements manually.

There are 2 levers you can control with GMV max:

1. **SKUs budget:** This is how much you are willing to spend per SKU in that day.
2. **Target ROAS**: This is where you choose a return on ad spend (ROAS) you’d like, and the algorithm works to meet it.

## **Advantages of GMV Max**

- **Automated optimization**: AI adjusts CPC to capture opportunities in real time.
- **Full placement coverage**: Ensures visibility across all Shopee ad surfaces.
- **Flexible goal setting**: Choose No ROAS target to maximize GMV or Custom ROAS for efficiency.

---

## **Challenges of GMV Max**

- **Limited control**: AI decides placement and SKU focus, leaving some SKUs underexposed.
- **Budget drain**: Spend can be front-loaded, reducing ad live time later in the day.
- **Efficiency trade-off**: Lower ROAS target drives growth but risks overspending; higher ROAS improves efficiency but reduces traffic.
- **Lacks insight**: Native reports give limited insight into how AI allocates spend and why.
