# Budget Distribution

Distribute campaign budgets intelligently to maximize ROAS and GMV efficiency.

## Overview
Budget Distribution automates how spend is spread across campaigns, ad groups, or products.  
It analyzes live marketplace data and reallocates budgets every 30 minutes.

Use it to:
- Avoid overspending on low performers.
- Double down on campaigns with strong conversion rates.
- Maintain balanced spend across stores.

## Key concepts

|------|--------------|

## FAQ
**Q: How frequently does it rebalance?**

No. Epsilo reallocates budgets at the campaign level; marketplaces still handle ad-level bidding.
