description: Learn how to invite teammates to your Epsilo workspace and assign roles for collaboration.
---
Collaboration in Epsilo starts by inviting your team to your workspace.  
Each new member receives a secure email invitation and can be assigned a specific role when joining.

---

## Overview

You can invite teammates to any workspace where you have **Owner** or **Admin** permissions.  
Invitations are sent via email and automatically expire after **7 days** for security.

After a member accepts the invite, their permissions are based on the assigned role:
- **Owner** – full workspace and billing control  
- **Admin** – manage members, storefronts, and automations  
- **Member** – run and monitor campaigns  
- **Viewer** – read-only access to dashboards  

> 💡 **Tip:** Use role-based access to control who can modify campaigns or automations.

## How to Invite a Member

1. Go to **Workspace Settings → Members**.  
2. Click **Invite** in the top right corner.  
3. Enter the teammate’s **work email address**.  
4. Select their role from the dropdown (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer).  
5. Click **Send invite**.

The invited user receives an email with a secure join link.  
Once accepted, they’ll appear in your workspace member list.

## Managing Invitations

### Resend an Invitation
If the user didn’t receive or lost their invite:
1. Go to **Settings → Members**.  
2. Find the pending invitation.  
3. Click **Resend invite**.

### Cancel or Revoke an Invitation
1. Locate the pending invite in the member list.  
2. Click **Revoke** to cancel access before acceptance.

### Expired Invitations
Invites expire automatically after **7 days**.  
You can resend them anytime using the same email address.

> 🔒 Only Owners and Admins can send, revoke, or resend invitations.

## Best Practices

- Always invite members using their **company-issued email** (e.g., `@brand.com`).  
- Review the member list quarterly and remove inactive users.  
- Assign **Viewer** roles to external partners who only need read-only access.  
- Use **2FA** or **SSO** to secure workspace logins.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| User didn’t receive an invite | Email filter or domain block | Ask them to check spam or whitelist `@epsilo.io` |
| Invite expired | The link was unused for 7 days | Resend a new invitation |
| Member already exists | Email is already active in workspace | Update their role instead of re-inviting |
