## Overview

Pick a script based on your objective (e.g., maximize impressions, control bids, reduce waste). For best results, always use paired scripts — an “increase” script with a matching “decrease” script — so performance stays balanced.

## Missing Opportunities

**Business question:** Do we have any paused ads that should be activated?

**Focus:** Re-activate paused ads that show signs of strong performance or potential (e.g., positive GMV or high ROAS). Poor-performing SKUs may be paused but later show good performance due to a delayed attribution window.

| **Ad Unit** | **Ad Type**        | **Condition**                                                       | **Action**       |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Placement   | Product search ads | Ads GMV `L7Ds` ≥ `0` AND Ads Spend `L7Ds` = `0` AND status = paused | Status → Ongoing |
| Placement   | Product search ads | ROAS `this month` ≥ Store ROAS plan AND status = paused             | Status → Ongoing |
| Object      | Auto product       | Ads GMV `L7Ds` ≥ `0` AND Ads Spend `L7Ds` = `0` AND status = paused | Status → Ongoing |
| Object      | Discovery ads      | Ads GMV `L7Ds` ≥ `0` AND Ads Spend `L7Ds` = `0` AND status = paused | Status → Ongoing |
| Object      | Product search ads | ROAS `L7Ds` ≥ 130% of Store ROAS plan AND status = paused           | Status → Ongoing |
| Object      | Auto product       | ROAS `L7Ds` ≥ 130% of Store ROAS plan AND status = paused           | Status → Ongoing |
| Object      | Discovery ads      | ROAS `L7Ds` ≥ 130% of Store ROAS plan AND status = paused           | Status → Ongoing |
| Object      | Product search ads | ROAS `this month` ≥ Store ROAS plan AND status = paused             | Status → Ongoing |
| Object      | Auto product       | ROAS `this month` ≥ Store ROAS plan AND status = paused             | Status → Ongoing |
| Object      | Discovery ads      | ROAS `this month` ≥ Store ROAS plan AND status = paused             | Status → Ongoing |

## Impression Maximization

**Business question:** Where can we acquire more efficient traffic?

**Focus:** Boost bids for ads that already meet or exceed ROAS targets, to gain more traffic.

| Ad Unit   | Ad Type            | Condition                                                                                    | Action              |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Placement | Shop search ads    | ROAS `this month` ≥ 150% of Store ROAS plan AND bid ≤ max threshold CPC AND status = ongoing | Increase bid by 10% |
| Placement | Product search ads | ROAS `this month` ≥ 150% of Store ROAS plan AND bid ≤ max threshold CPC AND status = ongoing | Increase bid by 10% |
| Placement | Discovery ads      | ROAS `this month` ≥ 150% of Store ROAS plan AND bid ≤ max threshold CPC AND status = ongoing | Increase bid by 10% |

## Bidding Control

**Business question:** Do we have any inefficient cases of bidding?

**Focus:** Reduce bids when ROAS is below plan to avoid overspending.

| Ad Unit   | Ad Type            | Condition                                                                                      | Action                    |
| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Placement | Product search ads | ROAS `this month` \< 130% of Store ROAS plan AND bid \> min threshold CPC AND status = ongoing | Decrease bid to min price |
| Placement | Shop search ads    | ROAS `this month` \< 130% of Store ROAS plan AND bid \> min threshold CPC AND status = ongoing | Decrease bid to min price |
| Placement | Discovery ads      | ROAS `this month` \< 130% of Store ROAS plan AND bid \> min threshold CPC AND status = ongoing | Decrease bid to min price |

## Waste Removal

**Business question:** Do we have any inefficient cases of ad activation to turn off?

**Focus:** Pause or deactivate ads that spend budget but do not generate sales or meet ROAS targets.

| Ad Unit | Ad Type            | Condition                                                                         | Action          |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Object  | Product search ads | Ads GMV `this month` = `0` AND Ads Spend `this month` \> `0` AND status = ongoing | Status → Paused |
| Object  | Auto product       | Ads GMV `this month` = `0` AND Ads Spend `this month` \> `0` AND status = ongoing | Status → Paused |
| Object  | Discovery ads      | Ads GMV `this month` = `0` AND Ads Spend `this month` \> `0` AND status = ongoing | Status → Paused |
| Object  | Product search ads | ROAS `this month` \< min ROAS plan AND status = ongoing                           | Status → Paused |
| Object  | Auto product       | ROAS `this month` \< min ROAS plan AND status = ongoing                           | Status → Paused |
| Object  | Discovery ads      | ROAS `this month` \< min ROAS plan AND status = ongoing                           | Status → Paused |

## Best Practices

- **Always pair scripts:** if you create an increase-bid script, add a decrease-bid script to balance it.
- **Segment ad objects:** apply scripts to clear cohorts (e.g., short-tail vs long-tail SKUs).
- **Customize for campaign days:** use more aggressive thresholds on spike days than in BAU.

## FAQs

**Q: Why do my bids only go up, not down?**\
Make sure you’ve paired each “increase” script with a matching “decrease” script.

**Q: What happens if two scripts act on the same ad? Which one takes effect first?**\
If you have two ongoing scripts on the same ad unit, you cannot choose which one runs first in every 15-minute interval. To control this, schedule those scripts in different time blocks each day.

**Q: Can I copy these use cases across campaigns?**\
Yes. When you set up a script, you can select ad units from different campaigns. If the script is already running, duplicate it and apply to other ad units.
