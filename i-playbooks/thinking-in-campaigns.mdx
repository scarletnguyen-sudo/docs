A guide to organizing SKUs into ad campaigns – covering grouping principles, segmentation models, and maintenance practices."

## Overview

Group SKUs that share targeting, budgeting, and scheduling needs.\
Only combine SKUs with matching ROAS targets and campaign timing.\
Begin with basic groupings (`Priority/Non-Priority`, `Proven/New`, `Short-Tail/Long-Tail`) and add complexity only when it directly affects bidding or budget decisions.

## Why Grouping Matters

A good grouping lets you:

- Apply one target (ROAS, Spend rate) to many SKUs effectively.
- Run the same schedule (e.g., double day, spike day) automatically.
- Report and optimize cleanly by intent (push, protect, test) without SKU-by-SKU micromanagement.

A bad grouping leads to:

- Uneven targeting that requires constant adjustment and troubleshooting.
- Excessive spend on less important products while priority ones don't get enough.
- Difficulty in scaling your campaigns effectively across peak and non-peak periods.

## Core Principle for Grouping

Group SKUs that share:

- A budget size or target (ROAS, Item sold, GMV, etc.)
- A budget cadence (daily / weekly / monthly)
- A schedule (on/off windows)

If any of these differ meaningfully, split them into separate campaigns.

## Practical Segmentation Models (Choose What Works for You)

Use these suggestions to define campaign groups. Start with **1–2** models and add more only when truly needed.

| **Segmentation Principle**             | **Description**                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🏆 **Business Priority**               | Priority (Must-Invest) vs Non-Priority SKUs            |
| ⌛ **Maturity Cohort**                  | Proven vs New/Unproven SKUs                            |
| 📈 **Performance Cohort**              | Short-Tail (top ~80%) vs Long-Tail (rest)              |
| 🏷️ **Promo Status / Event Readiness** | On-Promo vs Off-Promo vs Event-Only                    |
| 💰 **Price Tier / Pack Size**          | Entry / Mid / Premium or Small / Bundled / Family Pack |

## Example Case

Advanced users can apply multiple campaign segmentation models within a storefront to better address varying operational needs across different product groups.

In the following example, we combine 🏆 Business Priority, ⌛ Maturity Cohort, and 📈 Performance Cohort principles to group SKUs into campaigns — each with its own specialized bidding logic.

| Campaign Type                        | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Priority \| Proven \| Short-Tail** | Tight ROAS targets, always-on, event top-ups.         |
| **Priority \| New Launch**           | Discovery budget, impression-share focus, learn fast. |
| **Non-Priority \| Long-Tail**        | Limited bids, efficiency first, opportunistic boosts. |

You can run both **Auto** and **Manual** versions for each campaign (or start with one bidding model if your workflow prioritizes it).

## Ongoing Maintenance

- **Weekly:** Promote or demote between cohorts using KPIs (GMV, ROAS, Direct GMV/ROAS).
- **Before events:** Adjust budget and schedule for each campaign tier.
- **Monthly:** Reassess bidding effectiveness and add more segmentation cohorts if required.

## FAQs

**Q: Why does performance fluctuate within a campaign after applying recommended segmentation?**\
You may have unknowingly mixed cohorts in the same campaign. Review where you might need to separate them — e.g., _New Launch | Small Pack_ vs _New Launch | Bundled Pack_.

**Q: Why can’t I move SKUs between campaigns for re-segmentation?**\
Pause the SKUs first, then move them to the new campaign and resume afterward.

**Q: What if I end up with too many campaigns?**\
Collapse cohorts that share the same targets and schedules into a single campaign to simplify management.
